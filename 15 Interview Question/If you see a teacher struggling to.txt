What is the biggest lesson you learned from a teacher?
One of the biggest lessons I learned from a teacher was the importance of **resilience and continuous improvement**.  

During my school years, my English teacher once told me, *"Mistakes don’t define you, but how you learn from them does."* At that time, I struggled with expressing my thoughts clearly in writing and speaking. Instead of criticizing me, she encouraged me to practice daily, participate in debates, and read more. Over time, I saw myself improving, and this lesson stayed with me.  

Later, this mindset helped me in many areas—whether in academics, coding, freelancing, or my SSB attempts. Every setback became a stepping stone for growth. This lesson taught me that failure is never the end; it’s just feedback for improvement.
