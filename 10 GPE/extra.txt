be specific about the what first aid things you will provide to him, (What are the basic first aid that we must provide to the different kind of scenario that I must know that which cream to apply and which is commonly available in India also?)

Make the pair of the group even,

Brun injuries - under Tap Running water, Soframycin cream, Stretcher 
Fracture - stabilize or immobilize injured person, we used a straight stick as a temporary splint. We placed it along the injured area and tied it with a clean or sterilized hanker chief at both ends to keep the hand stable and prevent further movement until medical help arrived.
 	- We first stabilized the injured person, then used a rod and a clean handkerchief to secure the fractured hand, and quickly took him to the hospital.
Bullet Wound - If the bullet is lodged inside, don’t remove it — cover the wound with a clean handkerchief, apply pressure to stop bleeding, and rush to the hospital
		- If the bullet has passed through, cover and press both entry and exit wounds to control bleeding, then get immediate medical help.
Bleeding - We applied pressure to the wound using a clean handkerchief and rushed the injured person to the hospital.
Head Injuries - stabilize the head, cover it with a clean cloth, apply pressure, and rush to the hospital.
Snake Bite - Use soap water (alkaline in nature) to neutralize the snake bite (acidic in nature). If not available, pour clean water on the bite area and slow down blood flow by tying a clean handkerchief on both ends of the affected area.Remove the tight jewellery that is on his body like the ring necklace or banned (because of pressure). if possible click the photo of snake, if it happen in live.
